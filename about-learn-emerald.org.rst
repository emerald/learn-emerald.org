About ``learn-emerald.org``
===========================

The purpose of ``learn-emerald.org`` is to showcase the Emerald
programming language effort currently under way (2017-2021), led by
the
`Research Group for Programming and Software Engineering (PSE) <https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=150531>`_
at the
`University of Oslo (UiO) <https://www.uio.no/>`_.

``learn-emerald.org`` is a static site. This is to ensure a low
operational cost, and provide some longevity to the site's content.
For a more dynamic experience, you can visit the
`Emerald group on GitHub <https://github.com/emerald>`_.

The site is generated using `Hakyll <https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/>`_ â€”
a simple static site generator; written in, and configured using
Haskell. Hakyll is designed to keep the control flow of the site
generation process explicit, but high level. For instance, see the
`configuration file for this web site <https://github.com/emerald/learn-emerald.org/blob/master/site.hs>`_.

Hakyll also uses `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_, a universal document
converter, for the individual pages. This means that authors can
contribute articles written in pretty much any markup format they
like, so long as it is
`supported by Pandoc <http://pandoc.org/>`_.

If you would like to make a contribution, fix or point out a type-o,
or fashion this web-site is a far superior design, please visit the
GitHub project
`emerald/learn-emerald.org <https://github.com/emerald/learn-emerald.org/>`_,
where this site is maintained.
